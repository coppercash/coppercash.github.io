## 个人作品

+ ### [IPromise](https://github.com/coppercash/IPromise) *iOS Library*
  Promise lib in Swift conforms to [Promise/A+](http://promises-aplus.github.com/promises-spec), which manages the callbacks of async methods. Besides *chain* and *aggregate* required in standard, it supports additional features like *type safe*, *progress* and *cancel*.

  An app to practice listening, which was developed when I was in college. It has several features like LRC sync display and control progress and playback with gestures. Its server site is based on Python, and the data transfer is enciphered with SSL. I used a lib called [LAH](https://github.com/coppercash/Lazy_API_with_HTML) to fetch audio and lyrics from HTML web sites. LAH is a HTML matching language designed by myself to fetch useful data for iOS from web sites. It was also my graduation project.

## 其他

Capable to communicate in English. My previous boss is an American, we sent emails in English everyday. Besides, I take part in an English Salon to practice my oral English on every weekend.

Enjoy swimming. I can swim with 3 different strikes. I swim 2000m every Saturday and Sunday cost only about 1 hour.

Maybe this is not a shinning resume, but there is one thing may assist you to evaluate me more precisely. All my workmates or leaders invited me for several times to join the company they are serving currently. I believe this is because after worked with me, they all regard me as a reliable team-mate. Offer me an opportunity, maybe you would think this way too.

Thanks for reading my resume!
